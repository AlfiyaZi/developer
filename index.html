					<h4>Concept</h4>
					<p>The fundamental technical concept behind Open mHealth is the
						idea of an open software architecture and an ecosystem of software
						which adheres to the architecture. The goals of the open
						architecture and overall technical approach are:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>To foster software reusability in order to allow new
							applications to be built faster and to share innovations
							(software components, novel approaches) amongst software
							developers and health innovators.</li>

						<li>To standardize APIs to back-end data stores so client
							software may access any Open mHealth data store in a uniform way.</li>

						<li>To produce examples and documentation of these concepts
							meaningfully and simply.</li>

						<li>To be pragmatic, considerate and iterative in our
							approach.</li>
					</ol>


					<h4>Collaboration</h4>

					<p>
						In addition to an open architecture, Open mHealth aims to foster
						open collaboration between software developers, clinical experts
						and researchers. The scope of problems to solve is vast and the
						need for solutions is growing and multifaceted. One team cannot
						solve these problems, but we hope to collaborate with those that
						share our vision. Open collaboration means transparency first and
						foremost and we are working towards a set of formal working groups
						and a process for sharing the progress of working group meetings.
						For now, there is a <a
							href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omh-developers">Google
							Group</a> for any interested parties.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, there is open source. The Internet runs on open source
						software. The Internet and its underlying protocols, policies and
						loose organizational style are a fundamental inspiration to the
						Open mHealth team. All software produced by the Open mHealth team
						will be open sourced under the <a
							href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache
							2.0 license</a>. We encourage, but do not require, our partners to
						open source their software using the Apache 2.0 license. If open
						source is not an option due to intellectual property or other
						issues, we ask that you simply publish a well-documented API to
						your components or adhere to the Open mHealth specification
						relevant to your work.
					</p>

					<h4>The Key Architectural Abstractions</h4>

					<p>The architectural abstractions for Open mHealth are defined
						as modular software units:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>DSU: Data Storage Unit</li>
						<li>DVU: Data Visualization Unit</li>
						<li>DPU: Data Processing Unit</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Interoperability between each independent unit happens through the
						concept of a Schema ID (a URN-like colon-delimited string) which
						references a schema defined using the <a
							href="http://jojenki.github.com/Concordia/">Concordia schema
							language</a>. A DSU has a small specification while DVUs and DPUs are
						only required to publish their APIs and the Schema IDs that they
						can visualize or process. Both DPUs and DVUs communicate with DSUs
						using the DSU specification. All Open mHealth Software Units may
						support one or many Schema IDs.
					</p>

					<h4>Data Storage Units</h4>
					<p>
						A DSU provides a uniform way to access data though a series of API
						calls. The API calls that DSUs are required to implement are: (1)
						Registry Read, which returns a list of Schema IDs supported by a
						DSU, (2) Authenticate, which allows end-users to authenticate with
						a DSU, and (3) Read, which allows applications to read data
						associated with a particular Schema ID and end-user. We currently
						have an alpha DSU specification in use and a beta 1.0
						specification in the works. For more details, you can view
						supplementary documentation <a
							href="https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki/DSU-Overview">here</a>
						or jump right to the specifications <a
							href="https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki/DSU-Overview#specification-versions">here</a>.
						The Open mHealth DSU specification is designed to be deliberately
						simple and to take into account that many existing data stores
						already exist. The goal is to make it pragmatic and simple for a
						data store to become adherent to the Open mHealth DSU
						specification.
					</p>

					<h5>Data Integration</h5>
					<p>
						Our approach to data integration is also deliberately simple. Data
						is defined in terms of a Schema ID, Schema Version and a Concordia
						schema bound to the ID and Version. The idea is to map arbitrarily
						complex data structures onto a single identifier that may
						reference other identifiers already in use. The data structures
						themselves are represented using JSON. Schema IDs can reference
						extant identifiers through the use of an External ID. <a
							href="http://json.org">JSON</a> was chosen over XML because it is
						concise, it maps directly onto any existing XML structure, and
						because it is natively supported by JavaScript while robust
						libraries exist for it in many other programming languages.
					</p>

					<h4>Data Processing Units</h4>
					<p>
						A DPU represents a unit of work to be performed on JSON data. DPUs
						may be chained through multiple API calls. All that is required of
						a DPU is that it must have a well-documented open API and that it
						is stateless. A DPU may be available as a library to include in an
						application or as a simple HTTP-based service. For information and
						examples of DPUs, see this developer <a
							href="https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki/Open-mHealth-and-Data-Processing">article</a>.
						It is expected that the specification on a DPU will evolve as more
						use cases arise. If you have questions or comments, please feel
						free to join our <a
							href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omh-developers">developer
							group</a>. One requirement that is sure to be added to the DPU
						specification is that a DPU will have to specify which schema
						ID(s) it can operate on and which schema ID(s) the results it
						produces adhere to.
					</p>

					<h4>Data Visualization Units</h4>
					<p>
						A DVU embodies a visual representation of data for a particular
						Schema ID that may have been processed by a DPU or returned from
						the DSU Read call. We expect that most DVUs will live in a web
						browser. To that end DVUs should be written using JavaScript and
						HTML5 techniques. A collection of DVUs can form the backbone of a
						complete application for clinicians to use to assess patient or
						participant data. A DVU must publish its API and the Schema ID it
						supports. A DVU can be thought of as a library that any other Open
						mHealth developer can pick up and use. A developer article about
						DVUs can be found <a
							href="https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki/My-Comparisons">here.</a>
